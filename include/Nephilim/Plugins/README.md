This directory contains the official plugin SDK.

Through these interfaces, one can implement sophisticated functionality via dynamically loadable libraries.
If you want to develop a reusable module that runs at native speed and want to distribute it even for beginners,
a plugin is what you are looking for. Once you finish your plugin, anyone with the engine can drag it into their project
and start using right away.

============================================

Plugin code must include PluginSDK.h which provides the basic functionality to implement a proper plugin interface.
