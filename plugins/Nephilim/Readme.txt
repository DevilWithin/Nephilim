This directory contains all the sources for all plugins in Nephilim in an organized and clean way.
This makes it easy to just add a directory to any project to compile as part of the executable instead of as a plugin.

Also its easier for source control if plugins are organized this way, due to project file and their intermediate data mess.

The only rule is one directory per plugin, with its sources inside.
