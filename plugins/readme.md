# Official Plugins

This directory contains all plugins that aren't part of the core engine, but can be compiled to extend it and make it more powerful.

## Model Loader: Assimp
This plugin, once plugged into the engine, gives it the ability to load a lot of model formats as well as export to them if needed.

## Model loader: FBX sdk
This plugin gives the ability load from FBX files with the official SDK. It is useful to make sure we have bug free import to fallback to,
if needed. For example, Unity does the same and imports all models from it.
