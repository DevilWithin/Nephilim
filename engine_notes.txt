The public API of the engine is provided as a big amount of header files,
provided under the include/ directory. The includeext/ directory is also important but it includes
the third party code instead.

For organization, all engine header files are under the Nephilim/ directory, and are then spread across different folders,
so each module can be more or less self contained.

Graphics/ - Contain all rendering code, from the base interface to specific implementations for OpenGL, OpenGL ES, DirectX 10, DirectX 11, Software, etc
Network/  - Contain all network code in the engine
